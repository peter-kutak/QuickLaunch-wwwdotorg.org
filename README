QuickLaunch@wwwdotorg.org

= DESCRIPTION =

This extension adds a button for each Quick Launch .desktop file found
in ~/.local/user/quicklaunch to the Gnome panel.

= ALTERNATIVES =

If you don't know what a .desktop file is, and simply want to copy icons from
the existing menu structure to the panel as shortcuts, you're probably better
off using one of the favorites extensions such as:

= HOW TO USE =

.desktop files are text files that describe commands that can be run. They're
typically used to run graphical applications, but can run console applications
For a full specification, see:

http://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/

This extension scans the directory ~/.local/user/quicklaunch for files named
with a .desktop extension. For each file found, an icon is created in the
panel which when clicked will execute the command. While running, the
extension monitors the directory for any added, removed, modified, or renamed
files, and updates the set of displayed icons accordingly.

You can find existing .desktop files in system directories such as 
/usr/share/app-install/desktop/, or perhaps run "find /usr/share/ -name
'*.desktop'"

Or, you can manually create .desktop files using a text editor. Some example
.desktop files that I use is shown below:

== 00_sync_photos.desktop ==============
#!/usr/bin/env xdg-open

[Desktop Entry]
Comment=Synchronize photos
Exec=/home/swarren/bin/sync_photos.sh
Icon=unison2.27.57-gtk
Name=sync_photos.sh
Terminal=false
Type=Application
Version=1.0
========================================

== 01_vpn.sh ===========================
#!/usr/bin/env xdg-open

[Desktop Entry]
Comment=VPN to home
Exec=/home/swarren/bin/openvpn-vpn.sh
Icon=/usr/share/icons/gnome/32x32/devices/network-wired.png
Name=openvpn-vpn.sh
Terminal=true
Type=Application
Version=1.0
========================================

The icons are displayed in ASCII string sort order. You can obtain a specific
display order by prefixing your filenames with an incrementing prefix, for
example the 00_, 01_, 02, ... sequence in the examples above.
